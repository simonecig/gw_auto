     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  2*  2 procs)

     one-electron contribution =    -550.82559870 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     268.33676880 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -53.80659658 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -26.03872592 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  28 iterations
