     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  2*  2 procs)

!    total energy              =    -174.93470302 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          9.3E-13 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -560.01019683 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     287.49709875 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -54.50698031 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     152.08537537 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  19 iterations
